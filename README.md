# Auto Check Mail for Imported Accounts on Gmail

At a job I noticed that my colleagues were importing their work domain emails into GMail. I noticed that they suffered having to navigate to the Settings > Accounts and Import tab and click on "Check Mail Now" links for each imported account, each time they wanted to check their emails. Aparently the refresh button didn't fetch mail from external accounts. So, seeing this, I felt the need to script up something for them to ease their pain.

I did a quick search and found that a lot of people have encountered this and created a script like this one to do the job. You can find these solutions with a quick search on Google yourself if you wish. For this afternoon project I wanted to make a browser extension so I could share it with the other poor colleagues who have resorted to other means of checking their mail, just to give them the option.

# Why, in the name of all things good, is this on Github?
No good reason. In fact I can think of a good reasons to avoid having this available to public. 1. I probably won't ever maintain it. 2. It demonstrates terrible practices for programming (no tests, etc.). In any case, it's here if you are curious.

Anyway. Enjoy this terrible hacky script-turned-browser-extension responsibly. I made it very quickly. I probably won't ever maintain it.

Now I know the fundamental basics of how to make browser extensions. Ain't that lovely.
